# Learning Representations of Sets through Optimized Permutations

This is the official implementation of our ICLR 2019 paper [Learning Representations of Sets through Optimized Permutations][0] in PyTorch.
In this paper, we propose to encode sets of feature vectors into a single feature vector by learning to permute them, then encoding the permuted set with an RNN.
This avoids the bottleneck where a set of arbitrary size is pooled into a feature vector in a single step, which throws away a lot of information.

The main algorithm is contained in [`permutation.py`][1].
Experiments can be run through the scripts in the `experiments` folder, which calls `train.py` with the appropriate arguments.
The VQA experiment is located in the `ban-vqa` folder, which is a fork of the [ban-vqa][2] source code.
