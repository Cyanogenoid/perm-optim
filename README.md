# Learning Representations of Sets through Optimized Permutations

This is the official implementation of our ICLR 2019 paper [Learning Representations of Sets through Optimized Permutations][0] in PyTorch.
In this paper, we propose to encode sets of feature vectors into a single feature vector by learning to permute them, then encoding the permuted set with an RNN.
This avoids the bottleneck where a set of arbitrary size is pooled into a feature vector in a single step, which throws away a lot of information.

The main algorithm is contained in [`permutation.py`][1].
Experiments can be run through the scripts in the `experiments` folder, which calls `train.py` with the appropriate arguments.
The VQA experiment is located in the `ban-vqa` folder, which is a fork of the [ban-vqa][2] source code with an additional`permnet.py` and `permutation.py`.

## Commands
From the root directory, you can run:
- the sorting experiment: `experiments/sort.sh`
- the mosaic experiments: `experiments/mosaic.sh {mnist,cifar10}`, `experiments/mosaic-imagenet.sh`, `experiments/classify.sh {mnist,cifar10}`, `experiments/classify-imagenet.sh`
- reconstruct mosaics: `experiments/reconstruct-images.sh`

You can create the visualisations in the appendix by resuming from a trained model with various `--vis {0,1,2,3,4,5}` arguments to `train.py`, see the comments in the training script for more details.
